# Track Graph

Local web app to browse a DJ library on a **BPM × energy** map, with **Camelot** mix hints, playback, and set-moment overlays. BPM, energy, and key come from local analysis (~90s sample per file)—useful for exploration, not a substitute for Rekordbox when confidence is low.

Default scan folders (override with `.env`):

- `~/Music/tracks` — approved library
- `~/Downloads/To Curate` — intake / uncured batches

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manupastorr/track-graph.git
cd track-graph
./start.sh
```

`./start.sh` scans then starts the server. Open the URL printed in the terminal (default **http://127.0.0.1:8765**). Cached analysis is reused when files are unchanged.

For a faster scan after adding only a few tracks (skips mix-edge rebuild):

```bash
./start.sh --quick
```

First run creates a local `.venv` and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Share with someone else (separate Mac, own tracks)

Each person runs their **own copy** with **their own music folders**. The app does not sync libraries over the network.

### 1. GitHub access

Repo owner: **Settings → Collaborators → Add people** on [github.com/manupastorr/track-graph](https://github.com/manupastorr/track-graph).

### 2. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manupastorr/track-graph.git
cd track-graph
cp .env.example .env   # optional — only if paths differ from defaults
./start.sh
```

### 3. Music folders

Use the same layout on her Mac (or set paths in `.env`):

```
~/Music/tracks/
  House & Deep House/
  Melodic House & Techno/
  …

~/Downloads/To Curate/
  some playlist batch/
```

Supported audio: `.wav`, `.aiff`, `.aif`, `.flac`, `.mp3`

### 4. Custom paths (`.env`)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
TRACK_GRAPH_TRACKS_ROOT=~/Music/tracks
TRACK_GRAPH_CURATE_ROOT=~/Downloads/To Curate
TRACK_GRAPH_PORT=8765
```

Then `./start.sh` again. Each machine keeps its own `library.json` and `cache.json` (not in git).

## Manual commands

```bash
# Scan only
.venv/bin/python scan_library.py

# Scan with options
.venv/bin/python scan_library.py --workers 4 --skip-edges

# Server only (requires library.json)
.venv/bin/python server.py
```

## What it does

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `config.py` | Paths and port from env / `.env` |
| `scan_library.py` | Walks audio folders, analyzes tracks, writes `library.json` + mix edges |
| `analyze.py` | BPM (`bpm_confidence`), Camelot key, energy, vocals hint, Serato-style waveform peaks (full track) |
| `camelot.py` | Wheel colors + mix compatibility scoring |
| `server.py` | Flask: UI, `/api/library`, audio streaming |
| `static/index.html` | Single-page D3 graph + player |

### Layouts

- **Mix map** — tracks placed by BPM (x) and energy (y); soft clustering when many share the same values
- **Explore** — force graph by mix links; BPM/energy grid + set-moment clouds stay as background reference

### Generated files (gitignored)

- `library.json` — scan output for the UI
- `cache.json` — per-file analysis cache
- `scan.log`
- `.env` — local path overrides

Re-scan after adding tracks or changing analysis (`ANALYSIS_VERSION` in `analyze.py`).

## Tests

From the project folder (after `.venv` exists):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Scanner exclusions

Not indexed as library tracks:

- `samples/sample_*.wav` under `To Curate` — short clips from **soundcloud-set-id** set identification (Shazam probes). Keep `tracklist.md` / `tracklist.json`; delete `samples/` when done.

## Library organization (Manuel’s setup)

Genre folders, sorting rules, and curation workflow for the main library live in a separate notes file at `~/Music/tracks/AGENTS.md`. This tool only **reads** audio folders; it does not move or classify files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- See `requirements.txt` — installed automatically by `start.sh`
